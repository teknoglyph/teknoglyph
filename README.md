## Hi there 👋

I’m a lifelong tech enthusiast and gaming devotee, with over 20 years of experience across the games and technology industries. From retro classics to cutting-edge platforms, I’ve always been drawn to the creativity, innovation, and community that games inspire. 
When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me exploring the Pacific Northwest, trail running, traveling, or behind a camera capturing the world around me. I’m also passionate about making and enjoying music, films, tinkering with PCs, building apps, reading, and cooking (and eating) whenever I can. 
I can honestly say that very things compare to the smell of a freshly unboxed piece of tech.
