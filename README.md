## Hi there 👋

<img width="1405" height="343" alt="GITHUB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a88fee3-6ef3-4c78-924a-a8d64c0b88b1" />

I’m a lifelong tech enthusiast and gaming devotee with over 20 years of experience in the games and technology industries. From retro classics to modern platforms, I’ve always been inspired by the creativity, innovation, and joy that gaming brings. 
Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring the Pacific Northwest, trail running, traveling, or behind a camera capturing new perspectives. 
I’m also passionate about music, film, tinkering with PCs, building apps, reading, and cooking (and eating) great food. 
For me, nothing quite matches the thrill of unboxing a brand-new piece of tech.

I enjoy exploring GenAI, Python, and other tools to create apps that support both my work and hobbies. I’ve got plenty of ideas in the pipeline, so stay tuned for new projects here.
