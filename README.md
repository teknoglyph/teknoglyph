## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img width="1405" height="343" alt="GITHUB" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a88fee3-6ef3-4c78-924a-a8d64c0b88b1" />

Iâ€™m a lifelong tech enthusiast and gaming devotee, with over 20 years of experience across the games and technology industries. From retro classics to cutting-edge platforms, Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the creativity, innovation, and community that games inspire. 
When Iâ€™m not working, youâ€™ll usually find me exploring the Pacific Northwest, trail running, traveling, or behind a camera capturing the world around me. Iâ€™m also passionate about making and enjoying music, films, tinkering with PCs, building apps, reading, and cooking (and eating) whenever I can. 
I can honestly say that very things compare to the smell of a freshly unboxed piece of tech.
